# Mobile-Price-Classification

A classification problem on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification.
The objective is to predict the price range of a phone given its attributes.
Here I find the relationship between price range and phone attributes to find out what attributes affect the phone price.
I also build a deep learning model to predict price range of a phone.
